This files describes API changes in /completion/* - completion,
information provided here is intended especially for developers.

=== 3.11 ===
 * Modified completion criteria to allow plugins to override core completion logic.
 * Core now passes an additional parameter to '_get_completion_state'. This is an array representation of the completion results that have already been
   tested. Currently contains - viewed, usegrade, passgrade. Any plugin that are dependent on these criteria can now check this array instead of retesting it.
 * Introduced a new plugin function - '_get_completion_aggregation_state', that would indicate the aggregation type/relationship between the plugin and core
   completion criteria. This callback should either return a COMPLETION_STANDARD_FLOW / COMPLETION_CUSTOM_MODULE_FLOW. The former for default existing core
   behaviour while the latter enforces the override logic from the plugin. Defaults to COMPLETION_STANDARD_FLOW if not defined. This is useful when plugins
   need to override the core completion criteria in cases where it may be dependent on them. In these cases, the 'source of truth' would be the response
   from the plugin's 'get_completion_state' function. e.g. Quiz's completion defines a criteria of 'requires passing grade OR all attempts AND min attempts
   reached.' In these cases, even if a passing grade has not been achieved, the activity should be marked as completed if the no.of attempts have been reached.

=== 3.7 ===
 * External function core_completion_external::get_activities_completion_status new returns the following additional field:
   - valueused (indicates whether the completion state affects the availability of other content)
 * On the course page, only users with the capability 'moodle/course:isincompletionreports' (students, by default) can now tick the
   completion checkboxes. Teachers no longer get working checkboxes; tey see slightly different icons that indicate whether
   completion is enabled for the activity. These are the same icons which have always been shown to teachers before when the
   enabled the course editing mode.

=== 2.9 ===

* A completed and failed activity counts as a completed activity for
  course completion.
